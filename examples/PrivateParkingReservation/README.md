# Private Parking Reservation System

A privacy-preserving parking resource allocation platform built on Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, enabling confidential parking spot reservations with encrypted user data.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The Private Parking Reservation System revolutionizes urban parking management by implementing a decentralized, privacy-first approach to parking resource allocation. Built on blockchain technology with FHE capabilities, the platform ensures that sensitive user information remains encrypted while maintaining full functionality for parking operations.

## 🔐 Core Concepts

### Confidential Parking Reservations with FHE Technology

Our system leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to enable computations on encrypted data without revealing the underlying information. This breakthrough technology allows us to:

- **Process Private User IDs**: User identities remain encrypted throughout all operations while still enabling identity verification
- **Evaluate Confidential Credit Scores**: Credit assessments are performed on encrypted data, ensuring financial privacy
- **Conduct Secure Availability Checks**: Parking spot availability is computed without exposing sensitive booking patterns
- **Enable Anonymous Reservations**: Users can book parking spaces while maintaining complete anonymity

### Privacy-First Parking Resource Allocation

The platform implements advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure **privacy at every level**:

- **Encrypted On-Chain Storage**: All sensitive data is stored in encrypted form on the blockchain
- **Private Computations**: Complex business logic operates directly on encrypted data without requiring decryption
- **Anonymous Transaction Processing**: User activities cannot be traced back to real-world identities
- **Confidential Payment Systems**: Payment amounts and user balances remain completely private

### FHE-Powered Operations

Our smart contract utilizes **Zama's TFHE library** to perform the following encrypted operations:
- **Encrypted Comparisons**: Verify user eligibility without revealing actual values
